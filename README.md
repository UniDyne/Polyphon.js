Polyphon
========
**Polyphon**: *A sound and music generator in pure JavaScript*

### What Is It? ###
Polyphon allows one to generate music and sound programmatically in most web
browsers using the HTML5 Audio element, JavaScript, and a little bit of
magic. While this is far from efficient, the capability means that sound may
be transferred as quite compressible JavaScript to be generated on the fly
client-side, eliminating the need for extra resource files.

### The Name ###
Polyphon was the trade name of a large coin-operated music box manufactured
in Germany and Switzerland at the end of the 19th century. Like the music box,
music generated by Polyphon is quite primitive but still recognizable.
